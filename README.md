**The project aims to create a basic smart home system that allows remote control of four home appliances (e.g., lights, fans, or other electronic devices) using an ESP32 microcontroller and four relays. 
The ESP32 is a powerful, low-cost microcontroller with integrated Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities, making it ideal for IoT applications.**

**Components Needed**
ESP32 Development Board: The brain of the project, responsible for connecting to Wi-Fi and controlling the relays.

Relay Module (4-channel): Used to control the high voltage appliances. Each relay can be switched on or off by the ESP32.

Power Supply: A suitable power supply (typically 5V DC) to power the ESP32 and the relay module.

Connecting Wires: To connect the ESP32 to the relay module and the appliances.

Home Appliances: Four devices you want to control (e.g., lamps, fans, etc.).
